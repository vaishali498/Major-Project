  <!-- About Section -->
  <section id="about" class="about">
    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Farmigo was born from a vision to create a more equitable ecosystem for Indian farmers. Despite their critical role in our economy, many farmers still face challenges in accessing fair markets and digital tools. Our platform addresses this gap by providing a simple yet powerful marketplace that connects them directly with consumers, restaurants, and wholesalers.

      Built with modern web technologies, Farmigo is more than just an online store. It is a community-driven initiative focused on rural upliftment, traceability of produce, and promoting ethical food consumption.
      
      The platform allows farmers to digitally list their products, manage inventory, receive orders, and even track deliveries — all from their mobile phones. On the other hand, buyers can view product origins, check real-time availability, and place secure orders without the usual market chaos.
      
      As a part of our college major project, Farmigo represents the potential of technology in social development, combining software engineering with real-world impact. We believe innovation should not be limited to urban centers — it should reach the grassroots.
